## This Python program is a port scanner designed to explore a range of IP addresses and ports within a specific network. 

Its primary objective is to find and display ports that are open and available for connections on that network.

Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to input certain parameters such as the starting and ending IP addresses, as well as the starting and ending ports they wish to analyze. Once these details are entered, the program will:

   1. Iterate through the specified range of IP addresses.
   2. For each IP address, check the availability of ports within the specified range.
   3. Display the ports that are open and ready to receive connections.
   
	If no ending IP or port is specified, the application will default to using the starting value.

Additionally, it offers a 'verbose' mode, where it provides detailed information about each connection attempt, indicating whether a port is open or closed for each IP address.

Once the scan is completed, the program presents the found open ports or reports if no open ports were detected within that range of IP addresses and specified ports. Additionally, it shows the total time taken to complete this scanning process.

Finally, for user convenience, it waits for the user to press Enter to exit the program after displaying the results."
