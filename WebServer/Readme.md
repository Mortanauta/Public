Upon activation, this code initiates a server that displays your system's current IP address (which may include one or more, depending on your network) along with a port number, e.g., 192.168.1.1:8000. Entering this information into your browser allows access to the files within the folder, enabling viewing, execution, or downloading.

To prevent errors, the specific location of the shared folder is prominently displayed on-screen. The server's activity is also monitored for your convenience. To terminate the server, simply press Ctrl+C or close the window.

Essentially, this code empowers you to convert your device into a simple web server, effortlessly sharing local content with other devices on your network via a web browser, enhancing ease and speed of access.
