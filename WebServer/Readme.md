Upon activation of this code, a server is launched that displays one or multiple IP addresses (depending on your network), along with a port number, for example: 192.168.1.1:8000. Entering this information into your browser unveils the files in the folder, enabling you to view, execute, or download them.

For enhanced security and to avoid mistakes, the precise location of the shared folder is disclosed.

Essentially, this code empowers you to transform your device into a simple web server, providing the ease and speed to share local content with other devices on your network via a web browser.

To conclude the execution and cease sharing, simply press Ctrl+C or close the window.
