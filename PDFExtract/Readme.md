# ![](./Images/GitHub.png) &nbsp;&nbsp; PDF Text Extractor & Converter

## Extracts and converts PDF to  `Word` or `TXT`. 

# Introduction

In order to address the most common issues when working with PDFs, this time we have prepared two programs:
 - PDF Extractor: Extracts the text from **ALL** files in a given folder and saves it as Word or TXT with the same name as the PDF document. In both cases, the formatting that the PDF file may have is lost, meaning it only extracts the text.
 - PDF Converter: Converts a PDF file to Word, preserving formats and images. The result is not always good ðŸ¤¨ , it is recommended to review the final file.

# Quick Start

**Extractor**

Enter the path where the PDF files are located, select a path to store the TXT or Word files (or leave it blank to use the same as the source), finally, choose between Word or TXT as the destination file type and wait for the process to finish.

**Converter**

Enter the path of the file including its name, similarly enter the destination file address (or leave it blank to keep the name and folder), wait for the process to finish.

# Conclusion

Two pieces of software that allow us to extract / convert the content of a PDF.
